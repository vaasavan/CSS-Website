          <p>The above three are some of my most favourite cars, The one at the top, the Porsche(le mans winner) after the porsche is a Ferrari, also a le mans winner and then is the Lamborghini miura P400.</p>

            <h3>Engines:</h3>
            <p>I have an understanding that cars need engines to run, since this part is one of the most vital parts of the car, here is what I know about engines:</p>
            <p>As far as i know, there are many types of car engines but first lets start with the basic principles of an engine,</p>

            <h3>My Sideway Skill</h3>
            <p>The essentials which an engine requires to strart a car is Fuel, Heat, Air and Timing. The fuel is pumped into the intakes by the "pistons" which look like cylinders.</p>
            <p>The timing is decided by a computer, and the air is sucked in through intakes and since oxygen is a supporter of combustion and heats up the fuel, the term "Turbo Charged"</p>
            <p>Or the term "Super-Charged" or any other set of words which has the words "turbo" or "charged" means it just has the ability to suck in more air. I will explain piston arrangement.</p>

            <h3>There are many types of piston arrangement, I will only be explaining three seeing as there is so many.</h3>
            <p>The first type, known very commonly to most people as "V" arrangement, works according to the "V" arrangement of the pistons. Such as the way the pistons are arranged, there are "V" pistons arranging all the way from V2's to an abysmal number of V's such as V 20's</p>
            <img src="images/V.gif" alt="V piston arrangement">
            <hr>
            <p>The second type is also quite well known, it is known as "Inline" arrangement of pistons, this just means in essence the fact that the pistons are arranged in such a way that they don't have any particular shape, the pistons are just arranged in a straight line.</p>
            <img src="images/Inline.gif" alt="Inline piston arrangement">
            <hr>
            <p>The lat type is called "W" piston arrangement, true to the name the pistons are arranged *Drum Roll* in a W arrangement, as you can see the  people who named the piston arrangements are creative. The "V" and the Inline arrangement is coomon in normal cars, but the "W" arrangement is uised in race cars such as the Buggati veyron.</p>
