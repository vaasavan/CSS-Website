# CSS-Website

A free css framework for which you can use to make websites.



A framework made by angela yu from the AppBrewery except the secondary link "cars.html" was developed completely by me.

*INSTRUCTIONS*

The first thing you need to do is probably delete out the Lorem Ipsum and replace with your info, also take care of the copyright at the end and edit it to your name. After you have done that go to favicon.cc and make or import a image to that website, where it will be converted to an icon, name the icon var.ico after that fill in the source and alternations for the images, such as your profile pic and etc.

!ADDITIONAL INFO!

The CSS does not need to be edited and the classes in the html code have been changed also in the CSS the designs have been changed, to make your website look and work in the correct way I believe you should have the most basic understanding of HTML and CSS as I feel most of the code is easy to edit. Also the total amount of HTML files is 2 and the total amount of CSS files is also 2.
